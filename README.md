# Unhandled Exception in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications: improper error handling within route handlers.  Failure to handle potential errors (e.g., database errors) can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of this, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Problem:

The `bug.js` file contains a route handler that fetches user data from a database. If the user is not found, a 'User not found' message is sent. However, if there's an error during database access (e.g., network issues, database downtime), the application will throw an uncaught exception, leading to failure. 

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.js` file addresses this issue by adding comprehensive error handling. It uses a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle potential exceptions during the database operation.  This prevents the application from crashing and allows for more controlled error responses to the client.
